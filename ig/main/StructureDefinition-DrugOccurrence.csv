","Drug Occurrence OMOP Table","This table captures records about the exposure to a Drug ingested or otherwise introduced into the body. A Drug is a biochemical substance formulated in such a way that when administered to a Person it will exert a certain biochemical effect on the metabolism. Drugs include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as Drugs.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Base",0,*,"",""
