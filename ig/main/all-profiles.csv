Some Concepts are designated Standard Concepts, meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a clinical entity within the OMOP Common Data Model and within standardized analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one domain, which defines the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within data tables of the CDM.

Concepts can represent broad categories (like ""Cardiovascular disease""), detailed clinical elements (""Myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall"") or modifying characteristics and attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of a disease, associated morphology, etc.).

- It allows aggregation of multiple, closely timed doctor visits for the same Condition to avoid double-counting the Condition Occurrences.
For example, consider a Person who visits her Primary Care Physician (PCP) and who is referred to a specialist.
